This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description

This is a simple Next.js Todo application with Prisma database integration. This application utilises the Next.js routing style, client-server components/rendering, and "use server" and "use client" directives among other features. Seamlessly create, update, and manage todo items.

## Acknowledgments

The Next.js Todo app was created with inspiration from various online resources and tutorials. Its creation has been driven by a thirst for learning, a desire to grasp new concepts (ex: utilisation of server and client components), and a determination to engage in research and development within the realm of the Next.js framework.
